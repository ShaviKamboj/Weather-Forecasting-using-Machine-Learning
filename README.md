# Weather-Forecasting-using-Machine-Learning

### Project Overview
This project aims to build a weather forecasting model that can accurately predict the temperatures for the next day based on historical weather data. We utilize machine learning algorithms to develop a predictive model that can help in providing reliable weather forecasts for specific locations.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains historical weather data, including temperature readings, atmospheric pressure, humidity, and other weather-related metrics.

### Methodology
The methodology for developing the weather forecasting model involves the following steps:

- Data preprocessing: clean and prepare the dataset to handle missing values and ensure data integrity.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA): gain insights into the weather trends and patterns by performing EDA.
- Feature engineering: engineer relevant features that can help improve the forecasting model's performance.
- Model training and evaluation: train and evaluate different machine learning models, such as SGD Regressor and Random Forest Regressor, to predict the maximum and minimum 
  temperatures for the next day.
- Model selection: select the best-performing model for each target based on evaluation metrics, such as RMSE and R-squared.
- Model prediction and visualization: use the best models to make predictions on the test set and visualize the actual vs. predicted temperatures.

### Conclusion

Based on historical weather data, we have developed a weather forecasting model that can accurately predict the maximum and minimum temperatures for the next day. This model can provide reliable weather forecasts for specific locations, which can be helpful in various applications, such as agriculture, transportation, and energy management.

### Future Work
Improve our weather forecasting model by:

- Incorporating more weather-related features like wind speed and direction, cloud cover, and precipitation.
- Using other machine learning algorithms, such as deep learning models.
- Developing an ensemble model that combines the predictions of multiple machine learning models.
